Responsive Personal Website (BootStrap)

After learning the basics of html/css and some javascript, I decided to apply those skills in a project and what's better
than creating your first personal website.

A blacktie bootstrap template "http://www.blacktie.co" was used, I went over the design, understood how it was made then added 
my content and customized the styles.

This was just the begining, now I am working on developping three websites for the company i work for and its product lines.
